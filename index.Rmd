# **Christoph Wolter Lab Journal**

This is a template example for lab journaling. Students in the data science courses at the Institute of Entrepreneurship will use this template to learn R for business analytics. Students can replace this text as they wish.

## How to use

1. Accepted the assignment and get your own github repo.

2. Blog/journal what you are doing in R, by editing the `.Rmd` files. 

3. Saw the links page for lots of helpful links on learning R.

4. Change everything to make it my own.

5. Will have a lot of work...
